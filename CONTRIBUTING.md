# Contributing to Log Density Analyzer for Java

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer or contributer

## We develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)
All code changes happen through Pull Requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the OpenGL Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [OpenGL License](LICENSE.md) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
You can use our issue template, or follow the following guidelines:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Make sure you follow the current project structure.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its OpenGL License.
